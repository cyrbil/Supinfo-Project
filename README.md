## Installation
Projects are structured in developpement folders and releases folders.
See 'Readme' file for details, but normally all project can easilly be compiled.
Except when I'm to bored to include all librairies, projects are including libraries and release have all .dll and others require stuffs.

## Last note
Please notice that it's a 'test' folder and all under projects aren't guarantie to work perfectly.
Understand that release doesn't means 'all safe to run' but more 'working more or less as in the exercise'.
This Git is more to help people finding examples code that to provide a real software.
