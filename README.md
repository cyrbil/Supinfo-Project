This project regroup many exercises and personnal work made during Supinfo scholarity by Demingeon Cyril (aka Cyrbil)

See 'Readme' file into folders for details on projects.

## License
All file are under the [CeCILL_V2 license](http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL_V2-en.txt)
See link or 'license' file for more details.
Please notice that if a folder contain an other license file, it's overwrite this one.

## Installation
Projects are structured in developpement folders and releases folders.
See 'Readme' file for details, but normally all project can easilly be compiled.
Except when I'm to bored to include all librairies, projects include libraries and release have all .dll and others required stuffs.

## Last note
Please notice that it's a 'test' folder and all under projects aren't guaranty to work perfectly.
Understand that release doesn't mean 'all safe to run' but more 'working more or less as in the exercise'.
This Git is more to help people finding code examples than to provide a real software.
Cyrbil
